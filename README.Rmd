# baqgarchutil

The goal of baqgarchutil is to provide utility functions for mGJR class 
objects from the 
[mgarchBEKK](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgarchBEKK/index.html) 
package and making the process of fitting a model, performing residual 
diagnostics and visualizing the results of a news impact on the conditional 
covariance matrices as convenient as possible (within reason).

## Installation

You can install baqgarchutil from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sebinum/baqgarchutil")
```

## Example

An example will follow shortly.

```{r example}
## using the baqgarchutil package
