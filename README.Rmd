# baqgarchutil

**!! THIS PACKAGE IS STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPEMENT !!**

The goal of baqgarchutil is to provide utility functions for mGJR class 
objects from the mgarchBEKK package. This includes fitting a mean 
equation, analysing the residuals and applying/plotting a News Impact Function.


## Installation

You can install baqgarchutil from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sebinum/baqgarchutil")
```

## Example

Examples will be included once all planned functions have been implemented.

```{r example}
