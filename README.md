baqgarchutil
============

[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sebinum/baqgarchutil.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sebinum/baqgarchutil) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/baqgarchutil)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baqgarchutil)

Overview
--------

The goal of baqgarchutil is to provide utility functions for mGJR class objects from the [mgarchBEKK](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgarchBEKK) package and making the process of identifying conditional heteroscedasticity, performing residual diagnostics and visualizing the results of a news impact on the conditional covariance matrices as convenient as possible.

Installation
------------

You can install baqgarchutil from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sebinum/baqgarchutil")
```

Example / Usage
---------------

Each function in this package contains an example on how to use it. The next release will most likely contain a vignette with more background on the use and interpretation of a plotted news impact on volatility.
